			Welp, I lied about working on hitboxes.  Instead I did some house cleaning with some of the internals of the code and
            implemented the foundation for vertical gameplay, namely gravity and jumping. Some of the 'cleaning' was converting
            segments of code originally written for the Zealot into scripts so that they can be repurposed for other characters and
            objects.  I also added some variable feedback into the game itself (in the top left corner) so I wasn't skimming through
            a debug window that was flooded every time I ran the game.  This will streamline the testing procedure as I implement
            additional features.
            <br/>
            The characters are no longers moving along an invisible axis and instead are resting upon platforms with gravity
            affecting them anytime they're airborne.  The animations leave a lot to be desired but, functionally speaking, they work
            so I'm inclined to switch onto something else for a while.

			A new year and a new update.  This time I'm bringing the ability to crouch (block) as well as introducing the first NPC:
            a goblin.  The goblin's AI is straight forward, alternate between patrolling left and right with a pause in between.  
            If the player gets too close, the goblin will chase them attempting to get into range
            and attack them.
            <img src="PIGif4.gif" class= "visual" width = "600" height ="338" >
            At this point,  nearly all of the visual elements have been set up for combat so my next goal is to set up
            hitboxes and hurtboxes so that characters can fight.

			This update came far later than I had hoped. A cold, my work ramping up, and bunch of new game
			releases ganged up on my free time so Project Iron worked slowed down a bit.  That said, here we are! Since last
			time, I've added a proper sprint (distinct from the default run) as well as an attack animation.  Behind the scenes,
			I've been tinkering with standardizing the dash duration; currently, it varies based on what action the player
			was taking immediately before the dash.

			The first official update for Project Iron!  This gif demonstrates most of what I've produced thus far. Namely,
            a run, idle, dash, and turn animation, a 3 layer background that wherein each layer scrolls at a different pace
            to create a parallax effect, and the ability move left and right along the screen as well as a camera to compliment
            this capability.  On top of displaying progress on the game, I will occasionally show old files/bugs if I have an
            unprogressive week or just feel like it.  Stayed tuned for more.
