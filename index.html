			The first official update for Project Iron!  This gif demonstrates most of what I've produced thus far. Namely,
			a run, idle, dash, and turn animation, a 3 layer background that wherein each layer scrolls at a different pace 
			to create a paralax effect, and the ability move left and right along the screen as well as a camera to compliment
			this capability.  On top of displaying progress on the game, I will occasionally show old files/bugs if I have an 
			unprogressive week or just feel like it.  Stayed tuned for more.

			This site exists for the purpose of logging progress on a game that is going by the name as well as a place to 
			practice html.  There is also a tab for general blogging where I'll toss my incredibly qualified opinion on
			things such as games, movies, and anime.  Lastly, there's a tab where I talk a bit about myself.  Look forward to
			updates.
