			Long time no see.  This update came far later than I had hoped. A cold, my work ramping up, and bunch of new game
			releases ganged up on my free time so Project Iron worked slowed down a bit.  That said, here we are! Since last
			time, I've added a proper sprint (distinct from the default run) as well as an attack animation.  Behind the scenes,
			I've been tinkering with standardizing the dash duration; currently, it varies based on what action the player
			was taking immediately before the dash.

			The first official update for Project Iron!  This gif demonstrates most of what I've produced thus far. Namely,
			a run, idle, dash, and turn animation, a 3 layer background that wherein each layer scrolls at a different pace 
			to create a paralax effect, and the ability move left and right along the screen as well as a camera to compliment
			this capability.  On top of displaying progress on the game, I will occasionally show old files/bugs if I have an 
			unprogressive week or just feel like it.  Stayed tuned for more.

			This site exists for the purpose of logging progress on a game that is going by the name as well as a place to 
			practice html.  There is also a tab for general blogging where I'll toss my incredibly qualified opinion on
			things such as games, movies, and anime.  Lastly, there's a tab where I talk a bit about myself.  Look forward to
			updates.
