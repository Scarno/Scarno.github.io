			My name is Carson Hoff.  I am a 23 year old sloth wearing the skin of a man, obsessed with videogames and 
			the design behind them.  When I'm not gaming or doing the daily grind as a package handler, I work on a game 
			of my own.  Games have always had a particular magic in how they entrance the user.  Their unique characteristic of allowing interaction
			with the medium creates a dynamic wherein the user can look inward while they play. It is my dream to one day capture 
			even just a single person with games, in the same manner that they do me.
			<br/>
			Anime is another big hobby of mine.  I think the medium is often plagued with lowest common denominator appeal
			and can be reductive in how it approaches certain topics.  That said, once in awhile there's a piece of gold that 
			keeps digging through the mud worth it.
			<br/>
			I firmly agree with the phrase that 'variety is the spice of life' and so I dabble in others hobbies because you just never
			know what you could be missing out on.  I draw on occasion and have been thinking about picking up an instrument again.
