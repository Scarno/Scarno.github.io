			My name is Carson Hoff.  I am a 23 year old male wh thoroughly enjoys just about all manner of videogames.
			When I'm not playing them, I'm often daydreaming about the design that goes into them and as a life long
			goal, I aspire to create them for a living.  In the meantime though, I am designing my own first game in
			my free time while holding down a job as a package handler.  I also enjoy some anime but recognize much of 
			it is crap. My tastes in music vary a lot but I lean towards rock.
