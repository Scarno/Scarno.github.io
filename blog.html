			<p class = "date">January 9, 2019</p>
			<p class = "bd">
			Mob Psycho's second season follows the trappings of its first season, featuring the somewhat whimsical life of the awkward middle schooler, Mob.  He's written as having an extremely plain disposition showing 
			very little in the way of emotion which juxtaposes with the feats he can pull off as a psychic who works for a Exorcism business.  If you're familer with One-Punch man, you'd recognize the similar style of 
			character from Saitama (both were created by ONE.) Season 2 stays true to the first, feature some quirky school life antics that themed around Mob's maturing and beautifully animated fight scenes of his
			psychic battle.  Overall, I don't have much to say about Mob Psycho other than that I enjoyed the previous season and look forward to seeing the rest of this one going forward.

			<p class = "hd">JoJo's Bizzare Adventures: Golden Wind - Season 1 (-Episode 13) Review</p> <br/>
			<p class = "date">January 9, 2019</p>
			<p class = "bd">
			I felt conflicted on doing a season review when the show is going to continue going into the next season and  this season didn't really have a climax.  I've decided to go ahead with it though so that thoughts
			are kept fresh.  
			<br><br>
			Season 1 was almost entirely lent towards setting up the gang that Giorno is working with.  It is unlike part 3 and 4 in that the side characters jump to the forefront almost immediately rather than maintaining
			focus on JoJo for awhile.  The stands of the both the allies and the enemies have seen a greater amount of variation in my opinion which comes with positives and negatives.  The positive, of course, is 
			greater variation lends itself to some unique stands that really change the way that stand battles occur such as how Moody Jazz's (Moody Blues) power revolves around stepping through the motions of a
			specified person with VHS like controls, allowing the stand user, Leona Abbachhio, to uncover information that would otherwise be unavailable.  The negative to this is that the asspulls are far greater 
			as the niche style or rules behind the stands makes it less reasonable to have a full on brawl.  Giorna himself is arguably the worst offender in this case as it seems his stand's powers get ammended every
			couple of episodes.  That said, it's easy to overlook these weak instances of writing as JoJo is as bombastic as ever and treads the line of being completely non-serious and overly-serious, a mixture I've
			only ever seen the likes of Kojima pull off as well.  JoJo is still a joy and I look forward to this ongoing part.

			<p class = "hd">Sword Art Online Alicization - Season 1 (-Episode 13) Review</p> <br/>
			<p class = "date">January 9, 2019</p>
			<p class = "bd">
			Similar to JoJo, this show did not actually have a season finale and will be continuing into the next but I decided to throw together my thoughts now so I don't forget them later.  
			<br><br>
			I never wrote a First Impressions for this because I was initially not sure if I would actually watch it for a whole season but here I am so...woops.  If you've ever known the weaknesses of Sword Art Online
			as a whole then you will already know my complaints about this season of it as well.  The main character, Kirito, is nearly featureless, only ever showing determined and relaxed as his two moods.  Clearly
			written to be a stand-in for the reader.  His partner for this part of the show is Eugeo, a blond, less confident Kirito essentially who is also an AI.  I would wager that of the 13 episodes this season (not counting the recap
			one) a good 2-3 were dedicated to very heavy expositioning in the most blunt manner imaginable.  
			<br><br>
			This arc tackles the question of whether or not AI can ever truly hold the same intrinsic value of a human's soul.  As you can imagine, this is the topic that much of the expositioning centers around but they never
			really say anything meaningful one way or another. The show instead opts to have an antagonistic force present their view (AI is inferior to real people) in a dickheaded manner while a protagonistic force says the opposite.
			This presentation glosses over the details of the discussion in favor of showing dull battles and slice-of-life scenes in the virtual world that Kirito is stuck in after an attack puts him into a coma.  
			This debate also feels undermined by the fact that Kirito and Asuna, the main couple, adopted a virtual child in season 1 of the show.  This child has already demonstrated a full spectrum of emotions 
			so there's no question of which philosphy the writer is siding with and thus how this whole thing is going to play out.

			<p class = "hd">Castlevania - Season 2 Review</p> <br/>
			<p class = "date">November 5, 2018</p>
			<p class = "bd">
			Castlevania Season 1 was already one of my favorite animated pieces in years despite only having 4 episodes so to hear that the second season had come out and with twice as many episodes, I was thorughly
			excited for this.  And just like the previous season, this one struck many of the right notes on the head.  The scope of Dracula's hellbent invasion is expanded as we learn about a council of trusted allies
			he has gathered to confer with when making miltary decisions.  One interesting twist this season is that two members of his council are humans, the very race being genocided.  This fact mixed with the 
			some of the more power hungry vampires amongst the council create for some interesting interactions amongst the antagonists.  Meanwhile, the Trevor, Sypha, and Alucard also develop amongst one another as
			their unusual backgrounds are fleshed out.  Trevor is forced to reflect on the less than pleasant circumstances the Belmont household forced upon on him as a kid that turned him into the incredibly skilled
			vampire hunter he is today.  Alucard juggles his emotions as he must be resolve to kill his father in order to preserve the race and wishes of his late mother.  And Sypha acts as the most mature, talking
			each of them through their turmoils as the adventure continues.  The show does an excellent job balancing world building with character development between these two parties.  The animation is top notch 
			save for a few hiccups during particular scenes and Trevor's fights in particular feature beautiful choreography as he manipulates his whip to strike his enemies in skillful manners.  The final scene 
			was an unexpected gut punch and I really appreciate the creators' willingness to commit to the scene.  I eagerly await a season 3 for this show.  </p>

			<p class = "date">October 29, 2018</p>
			<p class = "bd">
			JoJo is back and this one is even more bombastic than the last in his attire.  He seems to be some sort of miscreant with a heart of gold as we see him conning people out of money but also willing to 
			buy a scoop of ice cream for random child on a whim.  Koichi makes a return, on a mission to find the son of Dio and protagonist of this part in Italy, Giorno Giovanna.  Koichi manages to get conned by the JoJo,
			having all his luggage stolen.  JoJo also has a run in with a fellow ruffian for working on his turf.  JoJo demonstrates he stand which involves the ability to turn things into biotic material and reflecting
			all damage inflicted unto them back to the source.  After dealing with this guy, he runs into yet another gangster, Bruno Bucciarati, who is trying to find who is responsible for beating up the other gangster.
			The episode ends with them squaring up for a stand battle.
			<br><br>
			This first episode left me a little irritated as I came not really understanding the powers nor the motives of the JoJo.  All previous JoJo's have been pretty simple in personality and drive which is arguably
			bad, but it felt fine as the overarching story and fights wind up so ridiculous that it helps make the whole thing more digestible.  The vague nature of Giorno's stand will certainly make for some asspull
			moments but it wouldn't be JoJo without them.

			<p class = "hd">Goblin Slayer - First Impressions</p> <br/>
			<p class = "date">October 29, 2018</p>
			<p class = "bd">
			The show starts off innocently, introducing us a young priestess who has just become an adventurer.  She is introduced to a group of fellow nooby adventurers who are antsy to go on their first quest.  She 
			hesitantly agrees and they set off immediately.  Their adventures takes a turn for the worse as their first targets, goblins turn out to be far more threatening that they had predicted.  All but the priestess
			wind up dead or abducted and as the goblins begin to surround her, a helmeted fifth adventurer appears and slays her attackers.  This man goes by Goblin Slayer.  Goblin Slayer goes on to clear out the goblins 
			entire nest, pointing out the tricks and errors that her adventuring party had made.  This character is merciless and stoic, not doing much to comfort Priestess but allowing her an outlet through vengeance.
			<br><br>
			While I enjoy a little indulgence in gore, I am always a little skeptical of shows that ride too heavily on the shock value that rides with it.  Furthermore, neither one of these characters had all that much
			in the way of character so I'm not totally convinced that it will still be interesting by the end of the season.  Lastly, I hope that the Goblin Slayer is not solely true to his name and hunts things other
			than goblins or else this show will not have many legs to stand on.
