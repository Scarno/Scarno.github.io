			<p class = "bd">
			Castlevania Season 1 was already one of my favorite animated pieces in years despite only having 4 episodes so to hear that the second season had come out and with twice as many episodes, I was thorughly
			excited for this.  And just like the previous season, this one struck many of the right notes on the head.  The scope of Dracula's hellbent invasion is expanded as we learn about a council of trusted allies
			he has gathered to confer with when making miltary decisions.  One interesting twist this season is that two members of his council are humans, the very race being genocided.  This fact mixed with the 
			some of the more power hungry vampires amongst the council create for some interesting interactions amongst the antagonists.  Meanwhile, the Trevor, Sypha, and Alucard also develop amongst one another as
			their unusual backgrounds are fleshed out.  Trevor is forced to reflect on the less than pleasant circumstances the Belmont household forced upon on him as a kid that turned him into the incredibly skilled
			vampire hunter he is today.  Alucard juggles his emotions as he must be resolve to kill his father in order to preserve the race and wishes of his late mother.  And Sypha acts as the most mature, talking
			each of them through their turmoils as the adventure continues.  The show does an excellent job balancing world building with character development between these two parties.  The animation is top notch 
			save for a few hiccups during particular scenes and Trevor's fights in particular feature beautiful choreography as he manipulates his whip to strike his enemies in skillful manners.  The final scene 
			was an unexpected gut punch and I really appreciate the creators' willingness to commit to the scene.  I eagerly await a season 3 for this show.  </p>

			JoJo is back and this one is even more bombastic than the last in his attire.  He seems to be some sort of miscreant with a heart of gold as we see him conning people out of money but also willing to 
			buy a scoop of ice cream for random child on a whim.  Koichi makes a return, on a mission to find the son of Dio and protagonist of this part in Italy, Giorno Giovanna.  Koichi manages to get conned by the JoJo,
			having all his luggage stolen.  JoJo also has a run in with a fellow ruffian for working on his turf.  JoJo demonstrates he stand which involves the ability to turn things into biotic material and reflecting
			all damage inflicted unto them back to the source.  After dealing with this guy, he runs into yet another gangster, Bruno Bucciarati, who is trying to find who is responsible for beating up the other gangster.
			The episode ends with them squaring up for a stand battle.
			<\br><\br>
			This first episode left me a little irritated as I came not really understanding the powers nor the motives of the JoJo.  All previous JoJo's have been pretty simple in personality and drive which is arguably
			bad, but it felt fine as the overarching story and fights wind up so ridiculous that it helps make the whole thing more digestible.  The vague nature of Giorno's stand will certainly make for some asspull
			moments but it wouldn't be JoJo without them.

			<p class = "hd">Goblin Slayer - First Impressions</p> <br/>
			<p class = "date">October 29, 2018</p>
			<p class = "bd">
			The show starts off innocently, introducing us a young priestess who has just become an adventurer.  She is introduced to a group of fellow nooby adventurers who are antsy to go on their first quest.  She 
			hesitantly agrees and they set off immediately.  Their adventures takes a turn for the worse as their first targets, goblins turn out to be far more threatening that they had predicted.  All but the priestess
			wind up dead or abducted and as the goblins begin to surround her, a helmeted fifth adventurer appears and slays her attackers.  This man goes by Goblin Slayer.  Goblin Slayer goes on to clear out the goblins 
			entire nest, pointing out the tricks and errors that her adventuring party had made.  This character is merciless and stoic, not doing much to comfort Priestess but allowing her an outlet through vengeance.
			<\br><\br>
			While I enjoy a little indulgence in gore, I am always a little skeptical of shows that ride too heavily on the shock value that rides with it.  Furthermore, neither one of these characters had all that much
			in the way of character so I'm not totally convinced that it will still be interesting by the end of the season.  Lastly, I hope that the Goblin Slayer is not solely true to his name and hunts things other
			than goblins or else this show will not have many legs to stand on.
